%\underline{NEW FUNCTIONALITY}
%\begin{itemize}
	\item Support for adjusting time step lengths using the adaptive time stepping (ATS) capability was added to the GWT Advection (ADV) Package of the Groundwater Transport (GWT) Model in release 6.6.0.  The same functionality that was added to GWT is now available with the Groundwater Energy Transport (GWE) Model.  A description of how this functionality works and how to activate it can be found in the release notes for version 6.6.0 (Appendix A) and in the MODFLOW 6 input-output guide.

\textbf{\underline{BUG FIXES AND OTHER CHANGES TO EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY}} \\
\underline{BASIC FUNCTIONALITY}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The PRT model previously allowed particles to be released at any time. Release times falling outside the bounds of the simulation's time discretization could produce undefined behavior. Any release times occurring before the simulation begins (i.e. negative times) will now be skipped with a warning message. If EXTEND\_TRACKING is not enabled, release times occurring after the end of the simulation will now be skipped with a warning message as well. If EXTEND\_TRACKING is enabled, release times after the end of the simulation are allowed.
\end{itemize}

\underline{INTERNAL FLOW PACKAGES}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CSUB package observations that could be specified using BOUNDNAMES was inconsistent with the input and output guide and allowed BOUNDNAMES to be specified for observations that should not be able to be accumulated. CSUB package observations have been modified so that flow observations are the only observations that can use BOUNDNAMES.
