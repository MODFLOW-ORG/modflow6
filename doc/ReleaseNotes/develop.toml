description = "The binary grid file's name may now be specified in all discretization packages with option GRB6 FILEOUT followed by a file path. If this option is not provided, the binary grid file will be named as before, identical to the discretization file name plus a ``.grb'' extension. Note that renaming the binary grid file may break downstream integrations which expect the default name."
