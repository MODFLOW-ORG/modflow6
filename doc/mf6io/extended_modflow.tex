Next to the standard \mf executable, a second, extended version of the program is made available. This version comes with more advanced functionality for which it partially relies on third-party libraries. Currently this concerns the parallel computing capability and the use of NetCDF4 for I/O data. Because the external dependencies increase the complexity of the installation procedure, \mf will remain available in its core set of functionality.

Extended \mf contains all features available in the standard edition, runs on the same input configuration, and produces the same results. Reversely, when running with the standard executable, some features described in this document (HPC Utility, NetCDF4 I/O) will not be available and their configuration will be ignored or an error is reported. These features will be labeled accordingly below.
