Source and Sink Mixing (SSM) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``SSM6'' as the file type.  Only one SSM Package can be specified for a GWE model.  The SSM Package is required if the flow model has any stress packages.

The SSM Package is used to add or remove thermal energy from GWE model cells based on inflows and outflows from GWF stress packages.  If a GWF stress package provides flow into a model cell, that flow can be assigned a user-specified temperature.  If a GWF stress package removes water from a model cell, the temperature of that water is the temperature of the cell from which the water is removed.  For flow boundary conditions that include evapotranspiration, the latent heat of vaporization may be used to represent evaporative cooling.  There are several different ways for the user to specify the temperatures.  

\begin{itemize}
\item The default condition is that sources have a temperature of zero and sinks withdraw water at the calculated temperature of the cell.  This default condition is assigned to any GWF stress package that is not included in a SOURCES block or FILEINPUT block.
\item A second option is to assign auxiliary variables in the GWF model and include a temperature for each stress boundary.  In this case, the user provides the name of the package and the name of the auxiliary variable containing temperature values for each boundary.  As described below for srctype, there are multiple options for defining this behavior.
\item A third option is to prepare an SPT6 file for any desired GWF stress package.  This SPT6 file allows users to change temperatures by stress period, or to use the time-series option to interpolate temperatures by time step.  This third option was introduced in MODFLOW version 6.3.0.  Information for this approach is entered in an optional FILEINPUT block below.  The SPT6 input file supports list-based temperature input for most corresponding GWF stress packages, but also supports a READASARRAYS array-based input format if a corresponding GWF recharge or evapotranspiration package uses the READASARRAYS option.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The auxiliary method and the SPT6 file input method can both be used for a GWE model, but only one approach can be assigned per GWF stress package.   If a flow package specified in the SOURCES or FILEINPUT blocks is also represented using an advanced transport package (SFE, LKE, MWE, or UZE), then the advanced transport package will override SSM calculations for that package.

\subsection{Stress Package Temperatures (SPT) -- List-Based Input}
As mentioned in the previous section on the SSM Package, temperatures can be specified for GWF stress packages using auxiliary variables, or they can be specified using input files dedicated to this purpose.  The Stress Package Temperatures (SPT) input file can be used to provide temperatures that are assigned for GWF sources and sinks.  An SPT input file can be list based or array based.  List-based input files can be used for list-based GWF stress packages, such as wells, drains, and rivers.  Array-based input files can be used for array-based GWF stress packages, such as recharge and evapotranspiration (provided the READASARRAYS options is used; these packages can also be provided in a list-based format).  Array-based SPT input files are discussed in the next section.  This section describes the list-based input format for the SPT input file.  

An SPT6 file can be prepared to provide user-specified temperatures for a GWF stress package, such a Well or General-Head Boundary Package, for example.  One SPT6 file applies to one GWF stress package.  Names for the SPT6 input files are provided in the FILEINPUT block of the SSM Package.  SPT6 entries cannot be specified in the GWE name file.  Use of the SPT6 input file is an alternative to specifying stress package temperatures as auxiliary variables in the flow model stress package.  

The boundary number in the PERIOD block corresponds to the boundary number in the GWF stress period package.  Assignment of the boundary number is straightforward for the advanced packages (SFR, LAK, MAW, and UZF) because the features in these advanced packages are defined once at the beginning of the simulation and they do not change.  For the other stress packages, however, the order of boundaries may change between stress periods.  Consider the following Well Package input file, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
# This is an example of a GWF Well Package
# in which the order of the wells changes from
# stress period 1 to 2.  This must be explicitly
# handled by the user if using the SPT6 input
# for a GWE model.
BEGIN options
  BOUNDNAMES
END options

BEGIN dimensions
  MAXBOUND  3
END dimensions

BEGIN period  1
  1 77 65   -2200  SHALLOW_WELL
  2 77 65   -24.0  INTERMEDIATE_WELL
  3 77 65   -6.20  DEEP_WELL
END period

BEGIN period  2
  1 77 65   -1100  SHALLOW_WELL
  3 77 65   -3.10  DEEP_WELL
  2 77 65   -12.0  INTERMEDIATE_WELL
END period
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In this Well input file, the order of the wells changed between periods 1 and 2.  This reordering must be explicitly taken into account by the user when creating an SSMI6 file, because the boundary number in the SSMI file corresponds to the boundary number in the Well input file.  In stress period 1, boundary number 2 is the INTERMEDIATE\_WELL, whereas in stress period 2, boundary number 2 is the DEEP\_WELL.  When using this SSMI capability to specify boundary temperatures, it is recommended that users write the corresponding GWF stress packages using the same number, cell locations, and order of boundary conditions for each stress period.   In addition, users can activate the PRINT\_FLOWS option in the SSM input file.  When the SSM Package prints the individual solute flows to the transport list file, it includes a column containing the boundary temperature.  Users can check the boundary temperatures in this output to verify that they are assigned as intended.

\subsection{Stress Package Temperatures (SPT) -- Array-Based Input}

This section describes array-based input for the SPT input file.  If the READASARRAYS options is specified for either the GWF Recharge (RCH) or Evapotranspiration (EVT) Packages, then temperatures for these packages can be specified using array-based temperature input.  This SPT array-based input is distinguished from the list-based input in the previous section through specification of the READASARRAYS option.  When the READASARRAYS option is specified, then there is no DIMENSIONS block in the SPT input file.  Instead, the shape of the array for temperatures is the number of rows by number of columns (NROW, NCOL), for a regular MODFLOW grid (DIS), and the number of cells in a layer (NCPL) for a discretization by vertices (DISV) grid.
