The PRT Model calculates three-dimensional, advective particle trajectories in flowing groundwater. The PRT Model is designed to work with the Groundwater Flow (GWF) Model \citep{modflow6gwf} and uses the same spatial discretization, which may be represented using either a structured (DIS) or an unstructured (DISV) grid. The PRT Model replicates much of the functionality of MODPATH 7 \citep{pollock2016modpath7} and offers support for a much broader class of unstructured grids. The PRT Model can be run in the same simulation as the associated GWF Model or in a separate simulation that reads previously calculated flows from a binary budget file. The version of the PRT Model documented here does not support grids of DISU type, tracking of particles through advanced stress package features such as lakes or streams reaches, or exchange of particles between PRT models.

This section describes the data files for a \mf Particle Tracking (PRT) Model.  A PRT Model is added to the simulation by including a PRT entry in the MODELS block of the simulation name file.  There are currently two types of spatial discretization approaches that can be used with the PRT Model: DIS and DISV.  The input instructions for these three packages are not described here in this section on PRT Model input; input instructions for these three packages are described in the section on GWF Model input.  Note that for a PRT Model, the maximum number of vertices for a cell in a DISV grid is limited to 8.

The PRT Model is designed to permit input to be gathered, as it is needed, from many different files.  Likewise, results from the model calculations can be written to a number of output files. Details about the files used by each package are provided in this section on the PRT Model Instructions.

The PRT Model reads a file called the Name File, which specifies most of the files that will be used in a simulation. Several files are always required whereas other files are optional depending on the simulation. The Output Control Package receives instructions from the user to control the amount and frequency of output.  Details about the Name File and the Output Control Package are described in this section.

For the PRT Model, ``flows'' (unless stated otherwise) represent particle mass ``flow'' in mass per time, rather than groundwater flow.  Each particle is currently assigned unit mass, and the numerical value of the flow can be interpreted as particles per time.

\subsection{Units of Length and Time}
The PRT Model formulates the particle trajectory equations without using prescribed length and time units. Any consistent units of length and time can be used when specifying the input data for a simulation. This capability gives a certain amount of freedom to the user, but care must be exercised to avoid mixing units.  The program cannot detect the use of inconsistent units.

\subsection{Time Stepping}
In \mf time step lengths are controlled by the user and specified in the Temporal Discretization (TDIS) input file.  When the flow model and particle-tracking model run in the same simulation, the time step length specified in TDIS is used for both models.  If the PRT Model runs in a separate simulation, the time discretization may differ.  Instructions for specifying time steps are described in the TDIS section of this user guide; additional information on GWF and PRT configurations are in the Flow Model Interface section.  By default, the PRT model will terminate particles at the end of the simulation's final time step; PRT can be configured to extend tracking until particles terminate naturally (i.e. at boundary conditions, sinks, or specified stop times) via Particle Release Point (PRP) package settings.

\subsection{Specifying Cell Face Flows using IFLOWFACE}

By default, flows associated with stress packages are assumed to be distributed uniformly over the volume of a cell. Distributed external inflows and outflows are reflected in the cell-cell flows calculated by the GWF Model, but they are not directly involved in determining the normal face velocities used to track a particle through the cell. The user can optionally assign a flow associated with a stress package to any face of the cell. Assignment of external flows is done by setting the value of an auxiliary package variable called IFLOWFACE to a value that corresponds to one of the cell faces. To accommodate non-rectangular cells, the IFLOWFACE numbering scheme in the PRT Model is based on clockwise ordering of the lateral cell faces. For a DIS-grid cell, IFLOWFACE = 1 corresponds to the ``western'' face, i.e., the face parallel to the y axis that has the lesser x coordinate. For a DISV-grid cell, IFLOWFACE = 1 corresponds to the face that extends in the clockwise direction from the first vertex listed for that cell in the CELL2D input block. IFLOWFACE numbering of lateral cell faces proceeds in clockwise direction. IFLOWFACE = -2 corresponds to the cell bottom, and IFLOWFACE = -1 corresponds to the cell top.

\subsection{Particle Mass Budget}
A summary of all inflow (sources) and outflow (sinks) of particle mass is called a mass budget.  The particle mass budget is printed to the PRT Model Listing File for selected time steps.  In the current implementation, each particle is assigned unit mass, and the numerical value of the flow can be interpreted as particles per time.

\subsection{Vertical Tracking}

When a particle is in the flow field, vertical motion can be solved in the same way as lateral motion. Special handling is necessary above the water table.

A dry cell is either an inactive cell or an active but dry cell, as can occur with the Newton formulation.

Normally, an inactive cell might be dry or explicitly disabled (idomain).  With Newton, dry cells remain active.

Of the flow model, PRT knows only what the FMI or exchange tells it. This includes heads, flows and the active grid region, but not whether Newton is on, where boundary packages are, or even which boundary packages are present.

Tracking and termination decisions must be made, therefore, on the basis of available information like whether a cell is active, whether the cell is dry, and whether the particle is dry (above the water table).

Release-time and tracking-time considerations are described (and implemented) separately.

\subsubsection{Release}

At release time, PRT decides whether to release each particle or to terminate it unreleased.

If the release cell is active, the particle will be released at the specified coordinates.

If the release cell is inactive, behavior is determined by the DRAPE option. If the DRAPE option is enabled, the particle will be released from the top-most active cell beneath it, if any. If there is no active cell underneath the particle in any layer, or if DRAPE is not enabled, the particle will terminate unreleased (with status code 8).

Since under the Newton formulation dry cells can remain active, the DRAPE option has no effect when Newton is on (assuming particles are not released into disabled grid regions). Vertical tracking behavior with Newton can be configured with tracking-time settings.

\subsubsection{Tracking}

A particle might find itself above the water table for one of two reasons: it was released above the water table, or the water table has receded.

With the Newton formulation, particles can be released into dry-but-active cells.

Particle trajectories are solved over the same time discretization used by the flow model. A particle may be immersed in the flow field in one time step, and find that the water table has dropped below it in the next.

A particle which finds itself in an inactive cell will terminate with status code 7. This is consistent with MODPATH 7's behavior.

A particle in a dry but active cell, or above the water table in a partially saturated cell, need not terminate. The PRP package provides an option DRY\_TRACKING\_METHOD determining how dry particles should behave. Supported values are DROP (default), STOP, and STAY.

If DROP is selected, or if a DRY\_TRACKING\_METHOD is unspecified, a particle in a dry position is passed vertically and instantaneously to the water table (if the cell is partially saturated) or to the bottom of the cell (if the cell is dry). This repeats (i.e. the particle may drop through multiple cells) until it reaches the water table. Tracking then proceeds as usual. If the vertical column containing the particle is entirely dry, the particle will terminate upon reaching the bottom of the model grid.

If STOP is selected, dry particles will be terminated.

If STAY is selected, a dry particle will remain stationary until a) the water table rises and tracking can continue or b) the simulation ends.

\subsection{Particle Track Output}

The PRT Model supports both binary and CSV particle track output files. A particle track CSV file contains the output data in tabular format. The first line of the CSV file contains column names. Each subsequent line in the file contains a row of data for a single particle track record, with the following fields:

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent Column 0: \texttt{`KPER'} {\color{red} \footnotesize{INTEGER}} \\
\noindent Column 1: \texttt{`KSTP'} {\color{red} \footnotesize{INTEGER}} \\

\item \texttt{2}: particle terminated at a boundary face

\item \texttt{5}: particle terminated in a cell with no exit face
\item \texttt{6}: particle terminated in a stop zone
\item \texttt{7}: particle terminated in an inactive cell
\item \texttt{8}: particle terminated immediately upon release into a dry cell
\item \texttt{9}: particle terminated in a subcell with no exit face
\end{description}

The IREASON field indicates the reason the particle track record was saved:

\begin{description} \itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item \texttt{0}: particle was released
\item \texttt{1}: particle exited a cell
\item \texttt{2}: time step ended
\item \texttt{3}: particle terminated
\item \texttt{4}: particle exited a weak sink cell
\item \texttt{5}: user-specified tracking time
\end{description}

By default, the PRT Model reports all particle events. The user can optionally select which events are reported, as explained in the Output Control (OC) subsection. Because multiple tracking events may coincide (e.g. exiting a cell and exiting a weak sink cell), particle track records may be duplicates except for the ISTATUS and/or IREASON codes.

The binary particle track file contains the same particle track data in a record-based binary format explained in the Particle Track File subsection of the Description of Binary Output Files section.
