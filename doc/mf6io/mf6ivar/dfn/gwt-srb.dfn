description is a text keyword to indicate that first-order decay will occur for sorbed solute mass.  If first-order decay is specified, then the RC variable must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.

description is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur for sorbed solute mass. If zero-order decay is specified, then the RC variable must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.
