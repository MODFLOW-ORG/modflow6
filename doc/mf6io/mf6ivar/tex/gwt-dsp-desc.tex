\item \texttt{XT3D}---activate the xt3d method to solve the dispersion term

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{diffc}---molecular diffusion coefficient.

\item \texttt{alh}---longitudinal dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{alv}---longitudinal dispersivity in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ALH.

\item \texttt{ath1}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{ath2}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH1.

\item \texttt{atv}---transverse dispersivity when flow is in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH2.
