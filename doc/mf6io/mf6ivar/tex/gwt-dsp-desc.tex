\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{XT3D\_OFF}---deactivate the xt3d method to and use the faster and less accurate approximation.  This option may provide a fast and accurate solution under some circumstances, such as when flow aligns with the model grid, there is no mechanical dispersion, or when the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities are equal.  This option may also be used to assess the computational demand of the XT3D approach by noting the run time differences with and without this option on.

\item \texttt{XT3D\_RHS}---add xt3d terms to right-hand side, when possible.  This option uses less memory, but may require more iterations.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{diffc}---molecular diffusion coefficient.

\item \texttt{alh}---longitudinal dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{alv}---longitudinal dispersivity in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ALH.

\item \texttt{ath1}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If mechanical dispersion is represented (by specifying any dispersivity values) then this array is required.

\item \texttt{ath2}---transverse dispersivity in horizontal direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH1.

\item \texttt{atv}---transverse dispersivity when flow is in vertical direction.  If this value is not specified and mechanical dispersion is represented, then this array is set equal to ATH2.
