\begin{description}
\item \texttt{strt}---is the initial (starting) concentration---that is, concentration at the beginning of the GWT Model simulation.  STRT must be specified for all simulations, including steady-state simulations. One value is read for every model cell. For simulations in which the first stress period is steady state, the values used for STRT generally do not affect the simulation. The execution time, however, will be less if STRT includes concentrations that are close to the steady-state solution.
