\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that SRB flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{FIRST\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that first-order decay will occur for sorbed solute mass.  If first-order decay is specified, then the RC variable must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{ZERO\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur for sorbed solute mass. If zero-order decay is specified, then the RC variable must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{rhob}---is the bulk density of the aquifer in mass per length cubed.

\item \texttt{distcoef}---is the distribution coefficient for the equilibrium-controlled linear sorption isotherm in dimensions of length cubed per mass.

\item \texttt{rc}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the sorbed phase.  The dimensions of rc for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of rc for zero-order decay is mass of solute per mass of aquifer per time.
