\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that IMD flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{SORBTION}---keyword to active sorbtion

\item \texttt{FIRST\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that first-order decay will occur for dissolved and sorbed solute mass in the immobile domain.  If first-order decay is specified, then the RC1 and RC2 variables must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{ZERO\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur for dissolved and sorbed solute mass in the immobile domain. If zero-order decay is specified, then the RC1 and RC2 variables must be specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{CIM}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to immobile concentration.

\item \texttt{FILEOUT}---keyword to specify that an output filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{cimfile}---name of the output file to write immobile concentrations.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FORMAT}---keyword to specify format for printing to the listing file.

\item \texttt{columns}---number of columns for writing data.

\item \texttt{width}---width for writing each number.

\item \texttt{digits}---number of digits to use for writing a number.

\item \texttt{format}---write format can be EXPONENTIAL, FIXED, GENERAL, or SCIENTIFIC.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{cim}---initial concentration of the immobile domain in mass per length cubed.  If CIM is not specified, then it is assumed to be zero.

\item \texttt{thetaim}---porosity of the immobile domain (dimensionless).

\item \texttt{zetaim}---mass transfer rate coefficient between the mobile and immobile domains, in dimenions of per time.

\item \texttt{rhob}---is the bulk density of the aquifer in mass per length cubed.  rhob will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORBTION keyword is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{distcoef}---is the distribution coefficient for the equilibrium-controlled linear sorption isotherm in dimensions of length cubed per mass.  distcoef will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORBTION keyword is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{rc1}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the aqueous phase of the immobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of rc1 for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of rc1 for zero-order decay is mass per length cubed per time.  rc1 will have no affect on simulation results unless either first- or zero-order decay is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{rc2}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the sorbed phase of the immobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of rc2 for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of rc2 for zero-order decay is mass of solute per mass of aquifer per time.  rc2 will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORPTION keyword and either first- or zero-order decay are specified in the options block.
